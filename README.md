# PHP Practice - API by T-Ralph

## Requirements
- Get a response from an API
- Convert a JSON object into a PHP object or array for the returned data
- A PHP page to render the returned data
- Include screenshots of your API call working in Postman

## Challenges
- Make it look nice with some CSS!
- Add a form to customize the request
- For example: If you choose a weather API, allow the user to enter their location and get the data specific to their location
- Build your own PHP API end-point and call from it via JavaScript
